# Zolotarev Low Pass Filter

This lpf filter has been described by Gary Cobb, G3TMG, in QEX (November-December 2016). 

Based on this model, Kjell LA2NI designed a complete low-pass filter, capable of handling 600W of RF power. 

It's the ideal companion for the Munin400 linear amplifier designed by the same author.
